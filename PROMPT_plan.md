I.  Study `specs/` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
II. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
III. Study the codebase with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand the structure and patterns.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents.
    - Study existing source code and compare it against `specs/`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks,
      and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented.

2. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns.
   Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered
   complete/incomplete using subagents.

**IMPORTANT**: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.
